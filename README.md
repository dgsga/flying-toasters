# Flying Toasters Screensaver for macOS

![Flying Toasters in CSS](img/flying-toasters-css.jpg)

Do you longingly reminisce about the days when flying toasters graced your screen?

If so, then never fear—CSS is here! Using modern CSS techniques like animations and transforms, we can recreate ***the***  After Dark™ screensaver.

The animations were made with CSS alone. No animated gifs or JavaScript.

Code uses the improved performance of WKWebView
